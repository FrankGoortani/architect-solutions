        <h1>AI, Agile, and the Return of Detailed Planning: A New Balance for Leaders</h1>
        <p class="meta">Frank Goortani</p>
        <h2>Introduction: When AI Meets Agile Development</h2>
        <p>
          Teams that embraced fast moving Agile methods now write exhaustive specifications
          before turning work over to AI coding assistants. Detailed plans help models follow
          intent, turning English into the hottest new programming language.
        </p>
        <h2>Why AI Is Changing the Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Generative AI excels at deterministic execution but fails when requirements are
          vague. Clear, unambiguous specs unlock efficiency gains of up to three times, while
          fuzzy prompts yield mediocre code.
        </p>
        <h2>The Lure of Detailed Specs</h2>
        <p>
          Some teams now spend triple the time on design, producing PRDs that read like legal
          contracts. Tools such as Amazon's Kiro enforce spec-first workflows, delivering code
          that works on the first try.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Clarity Was Always King</h2>
        <p>
          Agile never banned planning; it rejected rigid plans. AI exposes vague thinking and
          pushes teams to externalize knowledge for machine consumption. Good documentation is
          an ally, not an enemy.
        </p>
        <h2>The Risks of Overcorrecting</h2>
        <p>
          Overly rigid specs can still produce the wrong product. Maintain short feedback loops
          and validate each increment with users. Plan in detail for small chunks, then adjust
          as new insights emerge.
        </p>
        <h2>“Waterfall 2.0” – A Hybrid Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The future blends structured documentation with iterative delivery. Specs, design
          docs and tests become first-class artifacts consumed by AI agents throughout the
          lifecycle.
        </p>
        <h2>Leadership Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Leaders must promote clear specs while preserving agility. Documentation should be a
          living document, revised as feedback arrives. Human oversight and quality assurance
          remain critical.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          AI doesn't kill Agile; it kills vague thinking. Balance meticulous planning with
          continuous feedback to harness AI's speed without losing customer focus.
