        <h1>AI, Agile, and the Return of Detailed Planning: A New Balance for Leaders</h1>
        <p class="meta">Frank Goortani • 15 min read • 6 days ago</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction: When AI Meets Agile Development</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a software team that, after years of "move fast" Agile practices, suddenly
          writes a 50-page specification before coding a single feature. This scenario isn't
          fantasy — it's happening in response to new AI coding assistants. One startup
          reportedly tripled its development productivity by effectively going "full waterfall,"
          creating exhaustive specs and designs up front before turning things over to an AI
          agent to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          After decades of Agile evangelism, many teams are quietly returning to detailed specs,
          comprehensive planning, and upfront design. The reason? AI is extremely powerful at
          following exact instructions, but terrible at reading minds or filling in blanks. In
          the words of one AI expert, "the hottest new programming language is English" —
          meaning the skill of precisely describing what the software should do is more
          important than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift raises a critical question for tech leaders: Can we harness AI's strengths
          without losing the adaptability and customer-focus that Agile brought us?
        </p>

        <h2>Why AI Is Changing the Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Recent advances in generative AI (large language models) have given us coding
          assistants that can build entire features or applications from natural language
          descriptions. These AI agents excel at deterministic execution — if you give them
          a clear, unambiguous spec, they will tirelessly generate code to match. Studies
          have shown AI can boost coding task efficiency threefold in ideal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, today's AI cannot truly understand your business intent or ask clarifying
          questions the way a human developer might in daily stand-ups. It does exactly what
          you ask, literally what you ask — and nothing more. A vague prompt like "build a
          user dashboard" might yield a technically functional but underwhelming result. But
          a detailed page-by-page requirement document with explicit criteria will be
          implemented faithfully by the AI, down to edge cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, AI amplifies the consequences of ambiguity. Teams are learning that if you
          "wing it" with minimal instructions, the AI won't magically fill gaps — it will
          produce something broken or off-target. To unlock AI's productivity benefits, you
          must spell out requirements with a rigor that many Agile teams haven't practiced
          in years.
        </p>

        <h2>The Lure of Detailed Specs: Waterfall Planning Makes a Comeback</h2>
        <p>
          Tech leaders are observing a pattern: teams using AI are writing much more detailed
          design docs and specs than before — in some cases 3× more time is spent on up-front
          design. Product requirement documents start to read like legal contracts, and user
          stories now include exhaustive acceptance criteria covering every edge case.
          Architecture decisions are being finalized before a single line of code is written.
        </p>
        <p>
          One engineering leader dubbed this trend "Agile planning, waterfall execution." The
          idea is to retain short development cycles (sprints or iterative releases), but pack
          each cycle with far more upfront planning so that an AI can execute the plan without
          constant course-correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of this new approach comes from Amazon's experimental AI coding environment
          called Kiro. Kiro actually forces developers to choose between two modes:
          <strong>"Vibe" (exploratory chat-driven coding) vs. "Spec" (plan-first coding)</strong>.
          In Spec mode, the tool won't generate any code until you've written a requirements
          document, a technical design, and a detailed implementation plan — a workflow
          uncannily reminiscent of old-school waterfall processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasoning is simple: Kiro's creators found that users weren't giving AI enough
          detail to get high-quality results, so the tool itself acts like a project manager,
          guiding the team to plan more before coding. The outcome? In a trial project,
          following a strict spec→design→code sequence produced a "good quality" application
          that worked as intended on the first try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experienced AI developers echo this: they're writing longer prompts and feeding models
          very detailed plans, resulting in code with far fewer errors than "just winging it"
          with minimal instructions. As one AI engineer put it, "the agents we have right now
          need what waterfall provides even more than people do." In other words, AI thrives
          on the kind of exhaustive, upfront detail that waterfall methodologies championed.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Clarity Was Always King (and Agile Didn't Actually Ban It)</h2>
        <p>
          Before we declare Agile dead, it's important to remember: "Agile" never meant no
          planning or documentation. Agile practices always valued clear requirements and good
          design — they simply approach them iteratively and collaboratively. The Agile
          Manifesto, after all, favors "responding to change over following a plan," not
          ignoring the plan entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In healthy Agile teams, user stories are discussed and refined, acceptance criteria
          are defined, and architecture is considered continuously. If some teams took
          "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" to an extreme of zero
          documentation, that was a misapplication of Agile principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one commentator noted, "AI doesn't kill Agile. It punishes vague thinking." In
          effect, AI is shining a spotlight on any lazy or incomplete thinking in our software
          process. Teams that survived on unwritten tribal knowledge and on-the-fly decisions
          now must write things down for the AI to understand. This isn't a betrayal of Agile
          — it's a corrective for bad habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also worth noting that Waterfall methodology wasn't wholly bad, either. Its
          emphasis on analysis and design came from hard lessons about software quality. The
          problem was the rigidity: assuming all requirements could be known upfront and never
          change. Agile arose to embrace change and uncertainty, favoring working software
          over comprehensive documentation and continuous customer feedback. Those values
          remain as crucial as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, what we're seeing now is a recalibration: to work effectively with AI, teams
          are rediscovering the value of thoroughness. Think of it this way — Agile encouraged
          minimal documentation only because humans could clarify details through conversation,
          collaboration, and adaptation. But an AI agent lacks the context of hallway
          conversations or the intuition of an experienced engineer; the only way to give it
          that context is through explicit instructions and documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, when your team includes non-human "developers," you need to externalize
          knowledge more formally. The challenge for leaders is to do this without losing the
          agility to adapt when new insights emerge.
        </p>

        <h2>The Risks of Overcorrecting: Don't Throw Out Agile's Benefits</h2>
        <p>
          While detailed planning can dramatically improve AI's output, leaders must guard
          against swinging to the opposite extreme — a brittle, feedback-starved process. A
          key lesson from the past: a perfect spec on paper can still produce the wrong product.
          Markets change, users discover new needs, or simply the spec might have flaws that
          only become evident once working software is tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional waterfall projects often failed because they delivered something that met
          the original requirements but no longer met the real need, due to lack of intermediate
          checkpoints and adjustments. That risk still exists, AI or not. In fact, an AI will
          blissfully build exactly what you ask, even if your ask is misguided.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one AI practitioner observed from experiments, the AI could get "hung up"
          implementing a specification to the letter even when the spec didn't make sense in
          the real world — leading him to scrap the result and start over. In a human team, a
          developer might raise a question or flag an issue midway; an AI won't — it's a very
          fast, very literal worker. So if your plan is flawed, an AI will simply get you to
          a flawed result faster! Or as another expert quipped, "Waterfall will be a faster
          death march with AI" if you aren't careful.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this, retain short feedback loops. You might write detailed specs, but do
          it for smaller increments of work. For example, instead of a monolithic 50-page spec
          for a 6-month project, you produce a 5-page spec for this sprint's feature set, have
          the AI build it, then review and validate the output with real users or stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          This aligns with what some teams are calling mini-waterfalls or micro-iterations.
          Ed Lyons, an architect who experimented with AI-driven development, found success in
          running a series of "small waterfall" cycles inside an Agile project — essentially
          treating each feature or two as its own requirements/design/code cycle. He noted it
          felt like "a little too much documentation" (a reminder of why we moved to Agile),
          but it ensured the AI had all the info needed, and it still allowed adjustments
          between cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, this looks like Agile in macro (frequent releases and reprioritization)
          but Waterfall in micro (each piece built with thorough forethought).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another crucial practice is continuous validation. When an AI writes code, incorporate
          automated tests and verification against the spec at every step. Think of a
          "spec-to-validation" workflow: you feed the AI detailed requirements, it generates
          code, and then you immediately run test suites or even AI-driven checks to see if
          the code meets the spec.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something fails, you've caught the mismatch early and can correct course. This is
          analogous to traditional Agile's emphasis on getting working software in front of
          users fast — except now the "user" might first be a test harness or an AI validator.
          The goal is the same: ensure we're building the right thing before we've invested
          too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human oversight remains paramount; AI can and will produce errors or unintended
          solutions that pass superficial tests. A senior engineer or architect should review
          critical outputs. By front-loading clarity but still testing assumptions through
          quick iterations, you get the best of both worlds: the AI's speed and precision plus
          the human ability to steer the product toward real needs.
        </p>

        <h2>"Waterfall 2.0" — An Emerging Hybrid Approach</h2>
        <p>
          What might the future software process look like as we integrate AI? Many believe
          it's not a return to 1970s-style development, but rather a new hybrid paradigm
          sometimes dubbed Waterfall 2.0. In this vision, development is more structured and
          documentation-driven at each step (much like waterfall), but the overall process is
          still iterative and responsive (like Agile).
        </p>
        <p>
          Large Language Models become like specialized team members in each phase, consuming
          and producing project artifacts. For example, comprehensive Architecture Decision
          Records, API interface specs, design guidelines, test plans, etc., are not only
          written for human clarity but also to feed into AI tools that generate and validate
          code. All these artifacts are kept version-controlled (e.g. in a repository) as the
          single source of truth that both humans and AIs refer to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI might help draft these documents (speeding up the tedious parts) and then
          follow them when coding. In essence, documents and specifications become first-class
          deliverables and inputs in the development lifecycle, rather than afterthoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach also gives rise to new roles and practices. We're already hearing
          about roles like "Specification Engineers" who excel at writing precise software
          specs, or "AI Prompt Engineers" who craft effective prompts and constraints for LLMs.
          There are AI validation specialists to design tests ensuring the AI's output aligns
          with requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams might adopt AI orchestration, where multiple AI agents handle different stages
          — e.g. one AI generates code while another reviews security or style compliance. As
          a leader, you should recognize that writing and managing requirements is now a
          critical competency. Your team's productivity with AI will directly correlate to how
          well they can communicate objectives and constraints to the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investing in training staff on clearer technical writing, incorporating domain experts
          to define requirements, and adopting tools for managing specifications will pay off.
          This doesn't mean every engineer must become a novelist of technical specs, but it
          does mean the balance of work shifts: more time spent on what to build, so that less
          time is spent on wrestling with how the AI built it.
        </p>

        <h2>Leadership Perspective: Embrace Clarity, Preserve Agility</h2>
        <p>
          For technology leaders, the rise of AI development tools is both an opportunity and
          a test. The opportunity is huge — when guided well, AI can massively accelerate
          development and even reduce the grunt work (one can imagine a future where your team
          focuses almost entirely on high-level design and validation, while AI writes and
          refactors the code).
        </p>
        <p>
          Early adopters are seeing faster delivery times and the ability to tackle more
          ambitious projects with leaner teams. However, realizing these gains requires a shift
          in team culture and process. Leaders should encourage and reward the production of
          clear specifications, documentation, and test plans. Make it standard that any task
          handed to an AI (whether it's coding, test generation, or data migration) comes with
          a well-defined spec or acceptance criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practical terms, this might mean reviving practices from the past (brushing up
          those PRD and design document templates) and integrating them into your Agile
          ceremonies. For instance, sprint planning might include a step to write a mini-spec
          for each significant user story, which the AI pair-programmer will then implement.
          Daily stand-ups might include discussing not just code tasks but spec updates ("What
          did we learn yesterday that changes our requirements?").
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, preserve the essence of agility. Encourage teams to plan in detail
          but also plan to change the plan. If new information comes in — a user test shows a
          flaw, or a stakeholder tweaks the feature — don't let the hefty spec become a barrier
          to change. It's critical that everyone understands a spec is a living document, not
          a contract etched in stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Culturally, reinforce that feedback and iterative improvement are still expected. One
          way to do this is by shortening the planning horizon: allow detailed planning for the
          next few weeks of work, but hold off on spec-ing features further out until you
          periodically reassess. This keeps the organization adaptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, keep customers in the loop. Use Agile's practice of frequent demos or releases
          to gather user feedback on each AI-delivered increment, and be ready to rewrite specs
          for subsequent iterations based on that feedback. Remember, the ultimate measure of
          success is not how perfectly the team followed a plan, but whether the product
          succeeds for users and the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, be vigilant about the quality of AI outputs. AI may write syntactically
          correct code that passes basic tests, but it could introduce subtle bugs or
          inefficiencies. It might also strictly follow an imperfect spec without question.
          Hence, quality assurance and code review are still necessary — though their focus
          might shift more toward verifying alignment with requirements and overall system
          soundness.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might find that your QA engineers and developers spend more time reading and
          refining specs (before coding) and reviewing AI-generated code (after coding) than
          writing code themselves. That's okay — it's part of the new allocation of effort.
          Your job as a leader is to realign roles and expectations so that everyone knows
          where to add value in this AI-augmented process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers, for instance, may need to improve skills in prompt engineering and in
          interpreting AI output, debugging not just software issues but communication issues
          between humans and AI. Product managers might take on a stronger role in detailing
          requirements. Architects might produce more explicit guidelines (coding standards,
          architecture diagrams, interface contracts) that AI must adhere to.
        </p>
        <p>
          These shifts all aim at one thing: making sure the AI builds the right product, and
          builds it right.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: A New Balance, Not a Binary Choice</h2>
        <p>
          The advent of AI in software development is driving a return to some "old" ways (like
          thorough upfront planning), but this doesn't mean we simply rewind to the 1990s and
          forget everything we learned with Agile. Think of it instead as an evolution toward
          greater discipline. We are learning that humans and AI have different strengths:
          humans excel at creative thinking, understanding ambiguous needs, and adapting to
          change, whereas AI excels at following explicit instructions and churning out code
          or analyses at superhuman speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To leverage both, we must give the AI what it needs — clarity — and still retain our
          human-driven flexibility. In practical terms, some Agile principles may feel less
          emphasized (we are writing more documentation than "minimal," for example), but the
          core Agile mindset of frequent adaptation and stakeholder collaboration should remain
          intact.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a trade-off: "responding to change over following a plan" is still valid, but
          when the plan can be executed at lightning speed by an unthinking agent, you had
          better make sure the plan is correct — or be ready to change that plan often.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what "agile principle" dies first if we go down this path? Perhaps it's the
          misconception that Agile means no documentation or design. That was never a true
          principle, and it's certainly not sustainable with AI in the mix. The real Agile
          principles — like embracing change, delivering value quickly, and close collaboration
          — should not die. In fact, they become even more important to correct and guide the
          course of our AI-accelerated execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teams thriving with AI are not necessarily those with the fanciest models or
          tools; they are the ones who "finally learned to write down what they actually want,"
          and to do so in manageable increments. As a technology leader, you have the
          responsibility to set this balanced course. Embrace the rigorous thinking and planning
          that AI development demands, but don't lose the nimbleness that lets your organization
          pivot when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we strike that balance, we can have the best of both worlds: the foresight of
          careful planning plus the agility to continuously align with reality. In the end, AI
          won't kill Agile — it may just kill our bad habits and force us all to up our game.
          And that could be a very good thing for building software that's both high-quality
          and highly relevant in a fast-changing world.
