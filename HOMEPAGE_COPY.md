### Paragraph 1 - Current

I'm currently CTO at FasterOutcomes, an AI legal tech startup preparing for Series A. I joined as part-time CTO in March 2024, built the MVP in 12 weeks, and went full-time in January 2026 to scale the company from early revenue to Series A.

### Paragraph 2 - Journey

Before FasterOutcomes, I spent 4 years as Solution Architect at Uber, where I built the award-winning ELLE AI Decision Engine—a production LLM system serving Uber's global privacy operations.

My 25+ year career spans enterprise architecture at Canada Life and TD Bank, technical leadership at Home Depot Canada, and now startup CTO. I've consistently focused on one thing: building production AI systems that scale.

### Paragraph 3 - Expertise

I specialize in:
- Production LLM systems (RAG, AI agents, agentic workflows)
- Scaling engineering teams (startup to enterprise)
- AI-powered productivity (3-5x gains with modern AI tools)
- Technical strategy and decision-making
- 0→1 product development

### Paragraph 4 - Personal

I hold an M.Sc. in Management and B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from AmirKabir University. I live in Aurora, Ontario with my family. When I'm not building AI systems, I'm writing "The AI-Powered CTO" (launching end of 2026) and sharing insights with my 13K+ LinkedIn followers.
