# Image Generation Prompts for Architect Solutions Landing Page

This document contains detailed prompts for generating images for the Architect Solutions landing page using AI image generation tools like DALL-E or Midjourney.

## 1. Logo & Identity

### Company Logo - Standard Version
```
A minimalist, professional logo for "Architect Solutions", an AI consulting company. The logo should feature a clean, modern design with abstract geometric elements suggesting AI, architecture, or cognitive processes. Use a color palette of deep blues and teals. Should work well in both large and small formats. The design should convey innovation, technology expertise, and professionalism.
```

### Company Logo - White Version (for footer)
```
A white monochrome version of the Architect Solutions logo. Same design as the standard logo but in pure white for use on dark backgrounds. The logo should maintain its clarity and visibility even in this single-color format.
```

### Favicon
```
A simplified, square version of the Architect Solutions logo suitable for a favicon. Clean lines and minimal detail, focused on a single recognizable element from the main logo. Should be recognizable even at 16x16 pixels. Use the same color palette as the main logo.
```

### Apple Touch Icon
```
A higher resolution version of the Architect Solutions favicon, optimized for Apple touch icon format (180x180 pixels). Slightly more detailed than the favicon but still simplified compared to the full logo. Should look attractive on both light and dark device themes.
```

## 2. Hero Section

### Hero Visual - AI/Technology Concept
```
A striking hero image visualizing AI technology concepts. A photorealistic render featuring a glowing blue AI chip or processor with digital network connections emanating from it, set against a dark tech-inspired background. The image should suggest advanced technology, intelligence, and connectivity. Subtle blue and teal lighting effects provide depth and technological feel. The composition should allow for text overlay on approximately 40% of the image.
```

### Abstract Hero Background Pattern
```
An abstract technological pattern suitable for a website hero background. Featuring subtle digital/circuit-like lines, data flow visualization elements, and a gradient from deep blue to teal. The pattern should be non-distracting enough to allow text to be clearly legible when overlaid, but interesting enough to convey a sense of technology and innovation. Should have a somewhat ethereal, high-tech feel.
```

## 3. Service Icons (SVG already in HTML)

*Note: The service icons are already implemented as SVGs in the HTML, but if replacements are needed:*

### Consultation & Strategy Icon
```
A minimalist line art icon representing business consultation and strategy. Clean, modern design featuring elements like a lightbulb, brain, or puzzle pieces coming together. Simple enough to work as a small icon but distinctive enough to convey strategic thinking and consultation services. Monochromatic design that will match the site's color scheme.
```

### Training & Workshops Icon
```
A simple, elegant line icon representing education and training. Could feature elements like a graduation cap, open book, or people in a learning environment. Clean, professional design that works at small sizes while clearly conveying the concept of knowledge transfer and skill development.
```

### Pilot Implementation Icon
```
A sleek, modern icon representing pilot project implementation. Could include elements like a rocket launch, blueprint, or partially completed structure. Should convey the idea of testing, building, and deploying initial versions of solutions. Minimal, professional line art design.
```

### MCP Development Icon
```
A technical, abstract icon representing Modular Cognitive Processes (MCP) development. Could feature interconnected nodes, modular components, or a stylized brain with computational elements. Should suggest AI components working together in a modular system. Simple enough to work as a small icon while conveying technical sophistication.
```

## 4. Educational Section

### Agentic Coding Visualization
```
A detailed illustration visualizing the concept of agentic coding for AI systems. The image should show multiple AI agents working together on code/programming tasks, with visual indicators of communication between the agents. Use a modern, technical aesthetic with a blue color palette. Include abstract representations of code, decision trees, or algorithmic patterns. The image should convey collaborative AI systems working on complex problems.
```

### Modular Cognitive Processes (MCPs) Diagram
```
A professional, technical diagram illustrating Modular Cognitive Processes (MCPs). Show a system of interconnected cognitive modules working together, resembling a neural network or circuit board design with a human brain influence. Use a blue digital circuit board pattern with glowing connection points. The visualization should clearly convey the modular nature of these processes, showing how different cognitive functions connect and interact. Include subtle labels or indicators of different process types.
```

## 5. Team/About Section

### Founder/Team Professional Photo
```
A professional, corporate-style portrait of a diverse technology leadership team (3-4 people) in a modern office environment. Subjects should be dressed in business casual attire, appearing confident and approachable. The setting should feature subtle tech elements like screens or modern architecture. Natural but professional lighting with a clean, uncluttered background. The subjects should appear trustworthy, innovative, and experienced in the technology sector.
```
